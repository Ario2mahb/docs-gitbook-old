3. Protected your Brave wallet with a password&#x20;
4. Backed up your crypto wallet with a 12-word recovery phrase

&#x20;         c. _Chain’s currency name_: SGB&#x20;

&#x20;         d. _Chain’s currency symbol_: SGB&#x20;

&#x20;         e. _Chain’s currency decimals_: 18&#x20;

**Wrap and Delegate**&#x20;

Brave users can access existing decentralised applications (dApps) created by independent signal providers to wrap and delegate their SGB/WSGB, via the following steps:

1. Open Brave Browser and login to your wallet (make sure you are connected to Songbird)
2. Open a second search tab within Brave&#x20;
3. Enter the address of the website or dApp you wish to use to wrap and delegate in the search bar at the top of the screen. \*Delegating using this method is not exclusive to one specific signal provider, as some dApps (such as FTSO AU) allow you to choose from several different signal providers&#x20;
4. Follow the prompts to connect your Brave wallet and sign transactions when wrapping, delegating, or claiming rewards

Other signal providers are hosting similar websites or dApps for wrapping and delegation. See the full list of signal providers on Songbird here at- https://flaremetrics.io/ftso
