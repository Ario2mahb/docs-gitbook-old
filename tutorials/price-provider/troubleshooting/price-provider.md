### **I have increased my vote power, but the address is still not getting whitelisted, what is wrong?**

Addresses are whitelisted based on vote power as reflected in the vote power block of the current reward epoch. Increased vote power on a different block will not enable your address to be whitelisted.

### How do I find the vote power block of the current reward epoch?

In the FtsoManager [contract](https://songbird-explorer.flare.network/address/0xbfA12e4E1411B62EdA8B035d71735667422A6A9e/read-contract) use #8 for reading `getCurrentRewardEpoch`. Then use #13 `getRewardEpochVotePowerBlock` where one should set the current reward epoch number (from #8) and see the vote power block for that epoch.

### How do I check my vote power for a specific vote power block?

In the WNat [contract](https://songbird-explorer.flare.network/address/0x02f0826ef6aD107Cfc861152B32B52fD11BaB9ED/read-contract) use #26 `votePowerOfAt,` set the address and the block and read the response.

### My submissions are reverted as being in the wrong epoch

You might be submitting a bit too late in the current epoch. Try to submit the price a few seconds earlier. You might want to consider running an observation node that provides a better quality connection to the network. Also, check if you server time is synced with through Network Time Protocol (NTP).&#x20;

### **I am experiencing strange reverts when submitting and revealing prices**

The unexpected reverts might come from the too low gas amount provided to submit/reveal transactions. Increase the gas limit of the transaction to 2500000.
