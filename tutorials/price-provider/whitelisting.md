# Whitelisting

As a price provider, there are two separate whitelisting processes:

* Whitelisting your observation node with the flare team. See more in [setting-up-an-observation-node](setting-up-an-observation-node/ "mention")
* Whitelisting your price provider, which is a fully decentralized process detailed in [ftso-price-provider](ftso-price-provider/ "mention")&#x20;
